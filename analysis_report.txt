  Example 1:
    Arguably this is a very good "sequel", better than the first live action film 101
    Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! <br /><br
    />Cruella DeVil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very
    kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once
    tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog
    Shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate,
    have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and
    Oddball...<br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn
    Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name
    should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! One
    downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as
    excessive as the last film. This is also funnier than the last film.<br /><br />Enjoy
    "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
  Example 2:
    It's a good thing I didn't watch this while i was pregnant.I definitely would have cried
    my eyes out and/or vomit. It was Kind of gruesome mainly disturbing. I personally
    thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way.However as a mom I cringed
    when Beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when Virgina aborted the child during her
    3rd trimester with rusty utensils no less.Also,as an animal lover i almost cried when
    she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp.However,As creepy and sinister as the baby was I
    was rooting for it to live.And as twisted as the movie was I am extremely intrigued to
    see the sequel...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... .....

Sample texts:
  Example 1:
    An awful travesty of the Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian
    Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why
    pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her
    father, supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors
    and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor, to my knowledge,
    who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite
    miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as
    a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.<br /><br />There is some historical truth
    reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands
    agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also
    Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the
    Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian
    military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to
    surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is
    quite plausible, although I am not certain this actually happened.
  Example 2:
    Critters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist to the series, as it takes place in space,
    not in an earthly community. Good Effects and Acting make this movie a must see. I would
    recommend this to Horror/Science Fiction fans everywhere.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br
    /><br />Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive,
    Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks. For other
    recommendations, check out the other comments I have sent in by clicking on my name

Sample texts:
  Example 1:
    Hong Kong's first fully-fledged computer-animated movie is, for the most part, a treat.
    Distinctly Chinese in its orchestration, the fantasy elements are played up for the
    kids, the humour a little too cagey to really laugh at, while the martial arts
    spectacles are really quite astonishing. The story concerns local hero Hung Lang, a kung
    fu supremo, who befriends a talking bird (of course) and is sent on a dangerous
    adventure to retain the sacred Dragon Blade from the mystically cavernous underworld
    known as Asteria, facing insurmountable peril along the way, in order to slain the Boar
    King, a giant pig-looking tyrant causing havoc in the town. The characters are a little
    wet, particularly our soulless hero, yet Karen Mok's engaging sidekick Ying Ying is a
    worthy substitute, and the delirious spurts of action make the whole experience quite
    compelling.
  Example 2:
    Disappointed with this one. Let's start with the dubbing...it's terrible, I know
    Godzilla movies are supposed to be badly dubbed but they actually used professionals.
    Godzilla is missing for most of this movie and we have to watch boring characters we
    care nothing about blabber on and on about Godzilla but I want to see him fight and
    stomp Tokyo! The plot was even better in the American version. The ending is by far one
    of the worst and cheesiest I have ever seen and don't even get me started on the
    horrible CGI.<br /><br />Overall, this was pretty crappy. Monster fights were minimal
    and there was even less stompage. **/*****
