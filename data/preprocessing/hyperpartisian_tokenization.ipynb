      "[CLS] more on : japan ’ s politicians have been released from legislative deliberations, and are ever since the dpj came into power, the effort to force it back into an election has driven opposition parties, most notably the liberal democratic party ( ldp ). several rounds of no - confidence votes were put forward in the diet, one purportedly a deal between the dpj ’ s ichiro ozawa and then ldp president sadakazu tanigaki. electoral ambitions colored policy deliberations, and a policy consensus between the dpj and the ldp proved illusory. today ’ s excitement is enjoyed only by the politicians. personal loyalties are being tested, and individual politicians, first and foremost within prime minister noda ’ s own party, are sidling up to new partners in preparation for this next election. yet the notion persists that members of the dpj and the ldp, not all that far apart in their interests and sentiments, should become the foundation of another round of political realignment. for many japanese, the erosion of the single party dominance is lamented as part of japan ’ s political problem, and thus the solution is simply to build a new party that will once again bring the calm and stately management of government back in a new guise. but watching the currents of politics in tokyo these days, i find this idea of a grand coalition hard to grasp. first of all, this idea seems to overlook the fact that the dpj itself was a realignment of this type, a forging of a coalition among those who wanted to put forward a viable political party that could contest the ldp ’ s longstanding grip on power. the coalition that emerged as the dpj was hard to manage, however, once the party took power. second, the erosion in dpj membership, most notably the decision by ozawa and his followers to leave the party in july, may have strengthened the dpj rather than weakened it. those who remain — such as noda, katsuya okada, koichiro genba, seiji maehara, yukio edano, motohisa furukawa, and goshi hosono to name just a few — are staunchly reformist in their beliefs, and they have considerable experience in government. at a time when the party seems increasingly defined by their leadership, i find it hard to believe that they will want to merge with the ldp. finally, and perhaps most important, the scramble to form new parties suggests to me that japanese politics continues to fracture rather than congeal. these new parties aim to position themselves for leverage over the new government once the election is over. in the short term, the first casualty of this process could be the dpj as more and more politicians seek opportunity on the “ winning ” side or in opposition to their own party. the ldp president shinzo abe, seen as the most likely to succeed noda as prime minister, will have to demonstrate that he is able to lead a coalition government. the conservatives will need to vastly expand their legislative presence, currently at 118 seats in japan ’ s 480 - seat lower house. no one expects that they will be able to win a majority, but the margin of ldp victory will determine the shape of the coalition they lead. we should not expect politics in tokyo to go back to the old days of ldp dominance, although it will be interesting to see what the ldp has learned from its three years in opposition. secretary general shigeru ishiba consistently reminds his fellow conservatives that the ldp cannot expect to return to politics as usual. the new blood widely expected to come into the party in this election is not liable to accept the old rules either. these ldp newcomers will be ishiba ’ s children, like koizumi ’ s children ( 2005 ) and ozawa ’ s children ( 2009 ), and they will want to succeed visibly in their first term so that they can win public support and re - election. moreover, others coming up in the party, like the policy savvy and charismatic young political star, shinjiro koizumi, are not likely to want a return to the staid hierarchy of the old ldp either. like the dpj, the new ldp will need to be full of reform energy. so what is this political energy to be focused on? if it is simply a chance to deride the dpj “ experiment, ” then it will be a wasted effort. clearly, japan needs political reform, and each of the new contenders has some radical and not so radical ideas about how to accomplish it. the dpj in fact began their time in office with some new ideas about transparency and accountability, some of which were very popular with a japanese public that had grown frustrated with its entrenched bureaucracy and inward looking politicians. process level change, however, cannot be the sole goal. japan faces complex and contradictory sets of challenges. many of these challenges are economic, and in this, japan is no different than any other advanced industrial economy. but some of these challenges are particular to japan ’ s economic institutions and priorities, and how to energize this national economy in the context of a much changed and still changing global economy. demographics will matter also, and the social infrastructure to manage japan ’ s aging society is not yet fully in place or affordable. strategically, japan is in a much different place than it was even a decade ago, and how it positions itself in the world will depend largely on how it organizes itself internally to make decisions and to deliberate options. but it will also depend on a careful analysis of japan ’ s choices, including its alliance with washington and its strained relations with its neighbors. finally, some of the social patterns that informed national policy in japan just no longer exist today, as more and younger japanese have preferences and choices much different from their parents. women need a larger place in japan ’ s leadership if the country is to thrive. engaging japan ’ s women and youth in the project of recasting japan ’ s priorities is perhaps one of the most significant priorities today, and bringing them more fully into the process of politics will be the only way to mobilize their talents and interests looking forward. early reports suggest that the country has come through this tremendous test of its society with resilience and pride, and new ideas about japan ’ s future prospects have been informed by this experience. yet its politicians seem mired in the factionalism of the past, and limited in their ability to envision japan ’ s future. december 16 ought to be a referendum on japan ’ s future, and the people of japan will need to choose their next government based on the ideas and the vision for the future that will move their society forward. more on : more on : dr. paula briscoe is national intelligence fellow at the council on foreign relations. president obama ’ s trip to southeast asia this week brings into sharp relief the challenges facing the administration : how to retain influence in the region and honor commitments to allies without provoking china or furthering suspicions of encirclement. in numerous remarks and public statements president obama ’ s cabinet have been on message stressing the need for balance. on november 15, the day before the president departed on his five - day trip, the national security advisor, tom donilon, reiterated the importance that the united states places on getting this balance right : “ the united states is a pacific power whose interests are inextricably linked with asia ’ s economic, security, and political order. america ’ s success in the twenty - first century is tied to the success of asia. ” on her recent trip to australia and thailand with secretary of defense leon panetta, secretary of state clinton also presented a message of partnership and of u. s. neutrality regarding southeast asia ’ s territorial disputes. the australia - u. s. ministerial meeting ’ s 2012 joint communique despite these conciliatory statements, china remains concerned about the planned military build up and by attempts to bring diplomatic matters china would prefer to deal with bilaterally into multilateral forums. an example of the more cynical speculation about china ’ s concerns appeared in the china daily recently : to allay china ’ s concerns while maintaining u. s. influence in the region, the united states must : the u. s. strategy in

prime minister yoshihiko noda suddenly announced this wednesday that he would dissolve the lower house of parliament, and today marks the end of the democratic party of japan ’ s ( dpj ) majority in the lower house. opposition criticism of his leadership may have stung, but the long overdue passage of legislation to issue government bonds that should have been uncontested yet again raised questions about japan ’ s parliamentary contortions. noda ’ s final words repeated what he came into office arguing for — political reform of a government that seems unable to make decisions. politicians have been preparing for this moment for months, however. it was unquestioned that japan was heading for an election ; it was simply a matter of when. both of japan ’ s largest parties had reshuffled their leadership, and begun to organize for a lower house election. the dpj and the liberal democratic party ( ldp ) held their leadership races in september. the prime minister faced little opposition within his party. of course, ozawa ichiro ’ s departure in july in contrast, there was much excitement and anticipation surrounding the selection of the next president of the ldp. the ldp race, which the dissolution of the diet today means that the election will be held on december 16, with the official campaigning to begin on december 4. noda ’ s call for an election has surprised just about everyone, including members of his own party. politicians of all stripes have been scurrying to get ready for what will undoubtedly be an interesting campaign. a steady trickle of dpj members has filed into the party secretary ’ s office to tender their resignations. the opposition ldp is energized and excited, and ishiba, now party secretary - general, is clearly buoyant at his party ’ s prospects in this long awaited electoral fight. there are new contenders for power, also. osaka mayor toru hashimoto, now leading the japan restoration party, and recently resigned tokyo governor shintaro ishihara, head of the newly formed sunrise party, are in talks about leading a ” third option ” for reform in the electoral rumble about to unfold. yet their policy platform remains unclear at this writing. japan ’ s politicians are clearly in their element. already over 1, 000 have registered as candidates from a variety of parties, but the expectation is that this number could double or even triple in the weeks ahead. less clear, however, is how japanese voters evaluate the prospect of a new government, or even if they are interested in the contest for leadership of japan. in weeks leading up to december 16, i will explore some of the larger themes raised by noda ’ s decision to draw the curtain on the dpj ’ s first attempt to govern. so much is at stake for japan in the choice ahead. perhaps the overarching question is whether japan ’ s protracted effort at political reform will continue, and to what end. there are smaller narratives, however. what is the legacy of this first dpj effort to govern? does this new “ third option ” for reforming japanese politics, led by the leaders of japan ’ s two largest urban centers, offer a real alternative for japanese voters? what are the policies that will motivate the campaign? who will populate the new ldp, and what lessons has it learned in opposition? and, of course, what does all of this mean for japan ’ s foreign policy, especially for the u. s. - japan relationship? much to discuss, but today it is enough to say that, like the united states and china, japan too will have new leaders in 2012. unlike washington, there are multiple and proliferating parties to choose from in japan ’ s parliamentary process. more importantly, unlike beijing, it will be a democratic contest for national leadership. messy and chaotic, for sure, but prime minister noda has given us quite a lot to think about. more on : more on : as president barack obama sets off this weekend for a historic trip to southeast asia, he arrives at a high point for himself — and a low point for the region. obama, making his first trip since winning re - election at the polls, will be the first sitting american president to visit myanmar. the country has undoubtedly embarked upon historic reforms, yet is also embroiled in brutal ethnic violence. thailand, another stop on obama ’ s trip, is bracing for what could be a hugely disruptive leadership succession fight. the violence in myanmar ’ s southwestern rakhine state may have been sparked in part by the security forces, who are eager to retain a sizable role in the new myanmar, and it has also been facilitated by radical buddhist groups that have been attacking rohingya muslims in rakhine state and have made it nearly impossible for aid organizations like doctors without borders to even provide aid and relief to the tens of meanwhile, in thailand, a u. s. treaty ally and another country on obama ’ s itinerary, the situation is only marginally better. as the king of thailand ’ s health continues to decline — rumors suggest he has had multiple strokes and is operating at minimal brain capacity, and in his few public appearances he looks extraordinarily frail — thailand ’ s power centers are girding for the post - succession fight of the century. while the government of yingluck shinawatra enjoys a majority of popular support and control of parliament, yingluck and her brother thaksin, from exile, have been trying to slowly reduce the power of the country ’ s traditional unelected power centers, such as the military and the palace, in part by reshuffling the army to promote thaksin loyalists. but the top army leaders remain staunchly anti - thaksin / yingluck and extremely royalist, and in recent weeks a new group of middle - and upper - class protestors have descended on the streets of bangkok. ostensibly, they are protesting corruption in the yingluck government ( though yingluck ’ s government is not demonstrably any more corrupt than any previous thai government ) and they are protesting the possible return to thailand of the exiled thaksin, who still faces criminal charges back at home. in reality, the protestors, led by a former general linked to several privy councilors close to the king, are rallying bangkokians to push to oust the government, preferably through another military coup — an openly stated goal of many of the protestors. & # 160 ; the and above it all looms the crisis in asean, the leading regional organization. though asean ’ s secretary - general, surin pitsuwan, is thai, and previously served as thailand ’ s foreign minister, he has had little success in helping to mediate thailand ’ s political crisis. similarly, even though surin has pushed for a more assertive, regionally engaged asean secretariat, he has found himself unable to make much headway in addressing myanmar ’ s deadly ethnic conflicts either. on the eve of the president ’ s visit to southeast asia, the cfr southeast
